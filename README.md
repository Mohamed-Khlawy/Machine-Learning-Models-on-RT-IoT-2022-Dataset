# Machine Learning Models on RT-IoT 2022 Dataset

## What is the RT-IOT 2022 Dataset?

The RT-IoT2022 dataset is a proprietary dataset derived from a real-time IoT infrastructure.
It serves as a comprehensive resource integrating a diverse range of IoT devices and sophisticated network attack methodologies.
This dataset encompasses both normal and adversarial network behaviors, providing a general representation of real-world scenarios. Incorporating data from IoT devices such as ThingSpeak-LED, Wipro-Bulb, and MQTT-Temp, as well as simulated attack scenarios involving Brute-Force SSH attacks, DDoS attacks using Hping and Slowloris, and Nmap patterns, RT-IoT2022 offers a detailed perspective on the complex nature of network traffic.
The bidirectional attributes of network traffic are meticulously captured using the Zeek network monitoring tool and the Flowmeter plugin.
Researchers can leverage the RT-IoT2022 dataset to advance the capabilities of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), fostering the development of robust and adaptive security solutions for real-time IoT networks.
